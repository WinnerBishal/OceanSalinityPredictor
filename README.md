## Introduction
The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) is a unique partnership of the California Department of Fish & Wildlife, NOAA Fisheries Service and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. In this project we are using the dataset prepared by this organization which includes a lot of physical, chemical and biological data collected in different time intervals and different space in an ocean. Data of temperature, salinity, oxygen, phosphate, silicate, nitrate and nitrite, chlorophyll, transmissometer, PAR, C14 primary productivity, phytoplankton biodiversity, zooplankton biomass, and zooplankton biodiversity are collected and stored in csv file.

I used this dataset from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sohier/calcofi Since we have many different oceanographic data, in this project we are particularly interested in two features in an ocean viz. Temperature and Salinity. We are also interested in the relation between temperature and depth. Salinity is a measure of salt concentration in water. There are 864850 unique instances in the dataset. Since this is a fairly big enough dataset, we will try to answer some research questions.
